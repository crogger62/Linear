  <h1>Acme Pain Points Summary</h1>
  <section>
    <p class="title">Enhancing Compliance Tracking in Workflows</p>
    <div class="meta"><strong>Summary</strong></div>
    <p class="summary">The core concept uniting these requests is the need for improved tagging and tracking mechanisms for compliance-related tasks within project management tools. The primary pain point is the challenge of managing compliance obligations effectively, which can lead to missed deadlines and increased risk in regulated environments.</p>
    <div class="meta"><strong>Examples</strong></div>
    <ul>
      <li>Vercel: It would be helpful if Linear supported tagging issues with compliance frameworks like SOC 2 or ISO 27001. That would make it easier to audit our development process and prepare for certification reviews.</li>
      <li>Coinbase: We’d appreciate a mechanism to flag tasks that intersect with wallet infrastructure or custody flows. These areas are highly sensitive, and extra visibility would help us maintain reliability.</li>
      <li>Vercel: We’d like to see support for automated alerts when compliance-related issues are blocked or overdue. These tasks often have legal implications, and proactive notifications would help us stay ahead of deadlines.</li>
      <li>Vercel: It would be great if Linear allowed us to tag issues with customer-specific metadata, like contract terms or SLAs. That way, we can prioritize roadmap items based on enterprise obligations and avoid missing key deliverables.</li>
      <li>Vercel: We’d love a way to tag issues with compliance-relevant metadata, like data residency or audit scope. As we expand into regulated industries, tracking these requirements directly in our workflow would reduce overhead.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p class="title">Connecting Feedback to Product Development</p>
    <div class="meta"><strong>Summary</strong></div>
    <p class="summary">The core concept uniting these requests is the need for a seamless integration between customer feedback and product development processes. The primary pain point is the lack of visibility and connection between customer insights and internal decision-making, which hinders effective prioritization of features and investments.</p>
    <div class="meta"><strong>Examples</strong></div>
    <ul>
      <li>Brex: It would be useful if Linear allowed us to link issues directly to customer feedback from tools like Zendesk or Intercom. This would help Brex prioritize features that solve real pain points and close the loop between support and product.</li>
      <li>Vercel: It would be great if Linear supported visualizing how internal tooling improvements affect external product velocity. That connection is key to justifying infrastructure investments.</li>
      <li>Vercel: It would be great to visualize how roadmap items align with customer feedback from our dashboard analytics. That connection helps us prioritize features that drive engagement and retention.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p class="title">Need for Enhanced Compliance and Security</p>
    <div class="meta"><strong>Summary</strong></div>
    <p class="summary">The core concept uniting these requests is the necessity for improved compliance and security measures in product development. The primary pain point is the risk associated with manual tracking of regulatory standards and the exposure of sensitive financial information, which can lead to errors and potential breaches.</p>
    <div class="meta"><strong>Examples</strong></div>
    <ul>
      <li>Brex: We’d love to see Linear support automated compliance tagging for tasks and features that touch financial data. As a fintech company, Brex needs to ensure every product change aligns with regulatory standards, and manual tracking is error-prone.</li>
      <li>Brex: We’d love to see Linear support role-based access controls for sensitive issues. At Brex, some roadmap items involve confidential financial infrastructure, and limiting visibility based on team or clearance level would help us manage risk.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p class="title">Streamlining Compliance Management</p>
    <div class="meta"><strong>Summary</strong></div>
    <p class="summary">The core concept connecting these requests is the need for enhanced compliance management tools that facilitate tracking and reporting across different jurisdictions and milestones. The primary pain point is the inefficiency and potential errors associated with manual tracking of compliance requirements, which can hinder operational transparency and reliability.</p>
    <div class="meta"><strong>Examples</strong></div>
    <ul>
      <li>Coinbase: It would be great if Linear supported automated rollups of compliance-related issues by jurisdiction. Since we operate globally, tracking region-specific requirements in one place would reduce friction and improve transparency.</li>
      <li>Vercel: It would be great if Linear allowed us to generate compliance checklists tied to specific milestones. That way, we can ensure every release meets internal and external standards without relying on manual tracking.</li>
    </ul>
