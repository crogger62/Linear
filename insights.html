    <p class="title"><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Enhanced Issue Tagging for Prioritization</strong></p>
    <p class="representative"><span style="color:#0f4c81"><strong>Representative Customer Requests:</strong></span> <em>It would be valuable if Linear allowed tagging issues by financial thresholds or risk levels, enabling prioritization not only by effort or impact but also by potential exposure.</em></p>
    <div class="meta"><strong style="color:#0f4c81">Summary</strong></div>
    <p class="summary">The core concept here is the enhancement of issue tagging to include financial thresholds or risk levels, which would allow for a more nuanced prioritization of tasks. The pain point is the current inability to consider potential financial exposure when determining the order of work, limiting effective resource allocation. This improvement would enable teams to make more informed decisions based on a broader set of criteria.</p>
    <div class="meta"><strong style="color:#0f4c81">Examples</strong></div>
    <ul>
      <li>Vercel: ```
It would be valuable if Linear allowed tagging issues by financial thresholds or risk levels, enabling prioritization not only by effort or impact but also by potential exposure.  
```</li>
      <li>Brex: It would be helpful if Linear supported tagging issues with financial thresholds or risk levels. That way, we could prioritize work not just by effort or impact, but also by exposure.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="title"><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Prioritization of Work Based on Risk</strong></p>
    <p class="representative"><span style="color:#0f4c81"><strong>Representative Customer Requests:</strong></span> <em>Tagging issues with financial levels or risk levels.</em></p>
    <div class="meta"><strong style="color:#0f4c81">Summary</strong></div>
    <p class="summary">The core concept here is the prioritization of tasks based on their associated financial and risk levels, enabling more strategic decision-making. The main pain point is the challenge of effectively managing workload while minimizing exposure to potential losses. By tagging issues with these levels, teams can focus their efforts on the most critical areas that require attention.</p>
    <div class="meta"><strong style="color:#0f4c81">Examples</strong></div>
    <ul>
      <li>Coinbase: Tagging issues with financial levels or risk levels. Allows us to prioritize work not just by effort but by exposure.</li>
